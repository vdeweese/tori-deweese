                <p>RE: Enterprise Project Manager</p>
                <p>Rob Sweeney and team,</p>
                    <p>  I am crafting this letter (along with this website) to express my sincerest interest in your department, specifically for the role of Enterprise Project Manager. I am confidently writing to describe my skill sets that appear to be perfectly aligned with the role you are trying to fill. I am very excited to know that you are visiting my website! But before I talk about that, I want to highlight important educational qualifications that are missing from my resumé page. In May of 2017, I graduated from Kansas State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics. This education prepared me to think critically, creatively problem solve, and to never trust the "rational" consumer. For the majority of my post-graduation years I've been employed at FareHarbor, currently rounding out my 6th year. I've been pleased with the lack of economic models I've had to produce in my roles at FareHarbor and would like to keep it that way. So let's talk about project management! 
			    
            <p> I had this idea to build a website to showcase my resume about 2 years ago. It felt like a sensible first project. My current director supported my personal development goal of enrolling in a web dev bootcamp. After completing the 8-week bootcamp, I followed up with the first iteration of this very humble website which ultimately helped secure my promotion to Build Team Manager. This site is far from perfect but it has dutifully served its purpose by enabling my interest in learning front end code. Listed on this site, you'll find a range of projects of which I'm proud. These were included to illustrate my endless curiosity combined with effective project management skills. I've found ways to incorporate the efficiency of project docs into my daily life. For example, my Herb Catalog assists with Herbalism research, I customized a budget tracker to keep record of monthly financials, and last month I coordinated a lovely bachelorette weekend for my best friend with the ease of a project doc. I have a knack for planning ahead, keeping detailed notes, and making sure everyone is taken care of.  </p>
             
		<p> During a recent 1-on-1, <!-- Just last week --> a Builder jokingly told me I've earned the right to include "therapist" on my resumé, but I guess I thought the Cover Letter made more sense. I mention this to demonstrate that I possess the necessary soft skills required of a people manager. I'm a great listener practicing empathy and understanding. I've found joy in holding leadership roles over the past 4 years. But as much as I've excelled in those positions, I am again seeking to become an individual contributor at FareHarbor. This is a very exciting time as we charge ahead towards FH500 and I find myself wanting to be immersed in a quickly evolving and growth-oriented department like FH Sites. I'm motivated to contribute to the challenges your department faces ahead as we <em>"deliver on our next big bets"</em>!</P>
      
             <p> To conclude with modesty, I want to point out that I check every requirement box for this role. I hope I've made it very clear that I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I am proficient in necessary Google applications (see resumé). Translating FH dashboard features and updates to Account Managers and clients has been a leading skill of mine for the past 6 years. I can provide a catalog of Loom videos to support this claim. I'm positive my technical dashboard communication skills will translate well to websites. The 30 builders that I present to on a weekly basis could vouch for my verbal, written and presentation skills. I have intimate knowledge of processes of other departments that I've worked closely with including Sales and Account Management. Lastly, I'll agree with the written job description by saying that "calmly and confidently" is absolutely a winning strategy for meeting a deadline. I hope to get the chance to prove that point on your team!  </p>      
                 
                 <p>Sincerely, </p> 
                    <p> <em>Tori DeWeese </em></p>
