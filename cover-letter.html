                <p>RE: Enterprise Project Manager</p>
                <p>Rob Sweeney & team,</p>
                    <p>  I am crafting this letter (along with this website) to express my sincerest interest in your department, specifically for the role of Enterprise Project Manager. I am confidently writing to describe my skillsets that appear to be perfectly aligned with the role you are trying to fill. I am very excited to know that you are visiting my website! But before I talk about that, I want to highlight important educational qualifications that are missing from my resumé page. In May of 2017, I graduated from Kanasas State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics. This education prepared me to think critically, creatively problem solve, and to never trust the "rational" consumer. For the majority of my post-graduation years I've been employed at FareHarbor, currently rounding out my 6th year. I've been pleased with the lack of economic models I've had to produce in my roles at FareHarbor and would like to keep it that way. So let's talk about project management! 

	<!-- OLD		    This is an exciting time for the Build Team as we are developing new talent, continuing to embrace remote culture and approaching a new year. There is still much about this role to be defined and for what it's worth, there is still much I have to define about my leadership style. As a Team Lead I have prioritized building trust and communicating openly and clearly. Given the opportunity, in a manager role I would build upon that by also focusing on skill sharpening and meaningful team engagement.</p> -->
                    <p> I had this idea to build a website to showcase my resumé about 2 years ago. My current director supported my personal develpment goals of enrolling in a web dev bootcamp. After completing the 8-week bootcamp, I followed up with the first iteration of this very humble website which ultimately helped secure my promotion to Build Team Manager. Listed on this site, you'll find a range of projects that I'm proud of. These were included to illustrate my endless curiosity combined with effective project management skills. I've found ways to incorporate the effeciency of project docs into my daily life. For example, my Herb Catalog helps with my Herbalism research, I use a customized budget tracker to record my monthly financials, and I even coordinated a lovely bachelorette weekend for my best friend with the ease of a project doc. I have a knack for planning ahead, keeping detailed notes, and making sure everyone is taken care of.  </p>
     <!-- OLD               <p>  As a Team Lead, the best work days are the ones when I feel the most connected to the team. Those days can come in many forms, and they are more important now than ever before in this remote environment. Most recently, my favorite day of work was November 19 (National Treasure Day) when the Live Build Team worked together in the office and celebrated the past year of hard work. As we continue to navigate remote working, it's important to explore new techniques of engagement, information sharing and continued education. These ventures excite me and given the opportunity I would approach them with techniques of genuine appreciation and balanced feedback. There is a real opportunity for the Build Team to embrace hybrid work from home culture and become better for it. </p> -->
                    <p> Just last week, a Builder jokingly told me I've earned the right to include "therapist" on my resumé, but I guess I thought the Cover Letter made more sense. I mention this to demonstrate that I possess the necessary soft skills required of a people manager. I'm a great listener that practices empathy and understanding. I've found joy in holding leadership roles over the past 4 years. But as much as I've excelled in those positions, I am again seeking to become an individual contributor at FareHarbor. This is a very exciting time as we charge ahead towards FH500 and I find myself wanting to be immersed in a quickly evolving and growth-oriented department like FH Sites. I'm motivated to contribute to the challenges your department faces ahead as we <em>"deliver on our next big bets"</em>!</P>
      <!-- OLD              <p> The most challenging days as a Team Lead are the ones that can feel directionless. Improvement is the goal but what does that look like? Where do we start? I've found that the conversations in huddles and 1-on-1's are the best ways to realign priorities and find opportunities. As a manager there is the opportunity to engage more meaningfully with teammates, specifically with goal-setting. These conversations produce individual purpose and direction for the year and they can have a large impact on employee happiness. To those discussions I would bring energy and foster supportive autonomy. As someone who has successfully set and acheived stretch goals in the past, I believe I could successfully partner with builders to set attainable goals that connect to the broader team's goals. </p> -->
             <p> To conclude with modesty, I want to point out that I check every requirement box for this role. I hope I've made it very clear that I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I am profecient in necessary Google applications (see project links). Translating FH dashboard features and updates to Account Managers and clients has been a leading skill of mine for the past 6 years. I can provide a catalog of Loom videos to support this claim. I'm positive my technical dashboard communication skills will translate well to websites. The 30 builders that I present to on a weekly basis could vouch for my verbal, written and presentation skills. I have intimate knowledge of processes on other departments that I've worked closely with including Sales and Account Management. Lastly, I'll agree with the written job description by saying that "calmly and confidently" is absolutely a winning strategy for meeting a deadline. I hope I get the chance to prove that point on your team!  </p>      
  <!-- OLD                  <p>I've worn many hats on the Build Team as a mentor, a senior enterprise dashboard specialist and a leader so applying for the manager role feels like the natural next step. Natural, but not easy. This next step feels right but the decsision to apply was not made lightly. I care deeply about the Build Team, the people I work with and this company so the responsibilities that come with being a manager are not lost on me. Facing a new challenge is always exciting as well as humbling. Thank you for considering my application, I am looking forward to further discussions. </p> -->
                 
                 <p>Sincerest regards, </p>
