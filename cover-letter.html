                <p> November 27, 2021</p>  
                <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
                    <p>  I am very excited to apply for the Live Build Team Lead role. This position is the perfect way to expand on my mentor mentality, project management skills, and love for FareHarbor’s culture. As a senior member of the Build Team, I am confident that my experiences leading Builder Bootcamp and successfully juggling multiple projects as a Technical Expert and Senior Enterprise Builder will translate well into this leadership role.  </p>
                    
                    <p>  In 2019, I led four sessions of Builder Bootcamp. Since then, I have not stepped out of my role as a mentor. I recently began leading continued education sessions for the newest class of Account Managers. We’re covering topics such as Price Sheets, Advanced Reporting, Groupon/Vouchers and more. One of my favorite things about being a senior member of the build team is the opportunity to connect with members outside of our team on a professional level. </p>
                    
                    <p> As a Senior Enterprise Builder and Technical Expert, I have worked on various high-level projects that required cross-departmental collaboration. Last October, I participated in Spark as a 1:1 Co-Coordinator. This allowed me to work with management from Account Management, FH Sites, Channel Support and Onboarding. As a Technical Expert, I’ve worked with the Build team and Account Management team to improve and define the TE process. I would enjoy the opportunity to do the same on behalf of the Live Build team. </p>
                   
                    <p> With the majority being senior builders, the Live Build team is a rather self-sustaining team. However, there is quite a bit of potential for someone to successfully moderate and forecast the queue in order to improve the efficiency and productivity of the team. As a builder with a history of improving processes, I would gladly take on that challenge. I am applying for Live Build Team Lead with the goal of becoming a more prominent mentor and advocate for the team. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to discuss my ideas further. </p>
                   
                   <p>Sincerely, </p> 
                    <p> <em>Tori DeWeese </em></p>
